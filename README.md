## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:


### Prerequisites

* Ruby 2.7.0
* Rails 5.2.4
* Postgres: >=9.5
* Node.js
* Yarn


### Setup and Install

* Open your terminal - Windows: `Win + R`, then type `cmd` | Mac: `Command + space`, then type `Terminal`
* Navigate to a directory of your choosing using the `cd` command
* Run this command in your OS terminal: `git@github.com:German-Cobian/Philosophy.git` to get a copy of the project
* Navigate to the project's directory using the `cd` command
* Run `git checkout philosophy-feature` to work inside the proper branch of the project
* Run `rails webpacker:install` to configure Webpacker for your environment. Otherwise, an error like `Webpacker::Manifest::MissingEntryError` will appear if you attempt to run the server.
* Install dependencies by running `bundle install`
* Migrate the database to your environment by running `rails db:migrate` and then seed the app with data that is pre-packaged for its pages to display by running`rails db:seed`
* Navigate to the bin folder of the project using the `cd` command and then execute `rails server` to fire up the server
* Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to get into the app
* If you obtain the error `ArgumentError in Categories#index` it means that the app did not get successfully seeded. Run `rails db:reset` to get it seeded
* Copy `validates :image, presence: true` into `app/models/article.rb` (this validation does not allow the article database to be seeded if it is in place before running `rails db:seed`)
* Interact with the app using the links in the nav bar. To access private pages, sign up by clicking the `Sign Up` link
* To close the server, enter `Ctrl + C` in your terminal
